# Sometimes, you want to create a list of items that cannot be changed throughout the program. Tuples allow you to do that.

# A tuple is a list that cannot change. Python refers to a value that cannot change as immutable. So by definition, a tuple is an immutable list.

# Defining Tuple

details = ('Mahesh Sabnis', 'Pune', 47, 'sabnis_m@hotmail.com')

print(details[0])

# Converting A list in tuple

data = tuple([10,30,50,70,90])

print(data)
